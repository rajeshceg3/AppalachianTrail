# Progress Report - Appalachian Trail Experience

## Current State
- Project initialized with React, Vite, Three.js (R3F), and Tailwind CSS.
- Basic navigation flow implemented: Landing -> Map -> Experience (Georgia).
- Landing screen: Minimalist, serene design with entry button.
- Map View: Topographic aesthetic with selectable Georgia region.
- Georgia 3D Environment:
  - Low-poly foliage and terrain.
  - Atmospheric fog and soft morning lighting.
  - Ambient particles.
  - Positional audio placeholder.
- Project build verified and successful.

## Completed Requirements
- [x] Tech stack setup (React, Three.js, GSAP/Framer Motion, Tailwind).
- [x] Landing screen experience.
- [x] Basic topographic map system.
- [x] Region selection logic (Georgia unlocked).
- [x] Georgia 3D environment (basic version).
- [x] Loading transitions between states.

## Next Steps
- Implement remaining 5 regions (Smokies, Virginia, Mid-Atlantic, New England, Maine).
- Add actual ambient audio files for each region.
- Refine 3D assets and shaders for "Jony Ive-level" refinement.
- Implement "walk" movement (forward progression) instead of just OrbitControls.
- Add hover interactions for landmarks on the map.

## Completion Percentage
**25%**
